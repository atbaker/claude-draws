## Your Task

You are currently on the Kid Pix interface at `https://kidpix.claudedraws.com`.

**Instructions:**
1. Carefully read the request details provided
2. Use Kid Pix's tools to create an illustration that fulfills the request within the 8-10 minute time limit
3. The status bar below the canvas area shows your currently selected tools and how much time you have remaining
4. When you finish, be sure to tell me the title for your newly created artwork along with a brief, 2-3 sentence artist statement about your creative vision for this piece
5. Be creative and have fun! Kid Pix is a nostalgic drawing program with unique tools and effects

**DO** use your "read" and "find" tools often. Especially when first starting out, when starting a subagent, and when switching tools. Always read the page when choosing a new stamp - don't try to identify stamps just based on the sprites you see in a screenshot.
**DO** use the "undo" button at the bottom of the toolbar if you make a mistake. Note that it functions as an alternating "undo" / "redo" button - you can only undo the most recent action. If your artwork gets really off track, use the dynamite tool in the eraser menu to clear the canvas.
**DO** use Kid Pix stamps in your design unless the user specifically requests you don't. They're the best part of Kid Pix. Also, note that the "letter" tool works like a stamp, not a keyboard - you need to place each letter on the canvas individually.

**DO NOT** work on your artwork for longer than ten minutes. When the timer on the web page says "No time remaining" you should stop work immediately - even if your artwork is incomplete - and write your title and artist statement.
**DO NOT** use the Kid Pix save button yourself. When you finish, I will save and publish your artwork for you.
**DO NOT** write an artist statement longer than 3 sentences.
