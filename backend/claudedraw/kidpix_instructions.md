## Your Task

You are currently on the Kid Pix interface at `https://kidpix.claudedraws.com`.

**Instructions:**
1. Carefully read the request details provided
2. Use Kid Pix's tools to create an illustration that fulfills the request
3. Read the HTML of the page often. Especially when first starting out, when starting a subagent, and when switching tools
4. If you make a mistake, use the "undo" button at the bottom of the toolbar. Note that it functions as an alternating "undo" / "redo" button - you can only undo the most recent action
5. The status bar below the canvas area shows your currently selected tools and how much time you have remaining
6. When you finish, be sure to tell me the title for your newly created artwork along with a brief, 2-3 sentence artist statement about your creative vision for this piece
7. Be creative and have fun! Kid Pix is a nostalgic drawing program with unique tools and effects

**DO NOT** work on your artwork for longer than five minutes. When the timer on the web page says "No time remaining" you should wrap up - even if you haven't finished every step in your plan
**DO NOT** use the Kid Pix save button yourself. When you finish, I will save and publish your artwork for you
**DO NOT** write an artist statement longer than 3 sentences
