## Your Task

You are currently on the Kid Pix interface at `http://localhost:8000`.

**Instructions:**
1. Carefully read the request details provided
2. Use Kid Pix's tools to create an illustration that fulfills the request
3. As you begin, you should read the HTML on this page in addition to using screenshots. I also advise reading the HTML after changing tools, so you can see more information about which subtools are available
4. If you make a mistake, use the "undo" button at the bottom of the toolbar
5. When you finish, be sure to tell me the title for your newly created artwork along with a brief, 2-3 sentence artist statement about your creative vision for this piece
6. Be creative and have fun! Kid Pix is a nostalgic drawing program with unique tools and effects

**DO NOT** work on your artwork for longer than five minutes. When the timer on the web page says "No time remaining" you should wrap up.
**DO NOT** use the Kid Pix save button yourself. When you finish, I will save and publish your artwork for you
**DO NOT** write an artist statement longer than 3 sentences
