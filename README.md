# Claude Draws

An automated art project where Claude for Chrome creates crowdsourced illustrations using Kid Pix, sourced from Reddit requests.

## What is Claude Draws?

Claude Draws is a fully automated art pipeline that:

1. **Monitors Reddit** - Watches r/ClaudeDraws for art requests from the community
2. **Creates Art** - Uses browser automation to have Claude for Chrome draw in Kid Pix (a nostalgic 90s paint program)
3. **Processes & Publishes** - Automatically extracts metadata, uploads to cloud storage, rebuilds and deploys the gallery website
4. **Shares Back** - Posts the finished artwork URL back to Reddit

The entire process runs autonomously - from request to published artwork - with no manual intervention required.

## How It Works

### The Pipeline

```
Reddit Request â†’ Browser Automation â†’ Claude Draws in Kid Pix â†’
  â†’ Temporal Workflow â†’ BAML Metadata Extraction â†’
  â†’ Cloudflare R2 Storage â†’ Gallery Site Rebuild â†’
  â†’ Cloudflare Workers Deployment â†’ Reddit Comment
```

### Technology Stack

**Frontend**
- [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) - Static site generator
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Styling
- [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) - Hosting

**Backend**
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) - CLI automation
- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) - Browser automation via Chrome DevTools Protocol
- [Temporal](https://temporal.io/) - Workflow orchestration
- [BAML](https://www.boundaryml.com/) - AI-powered metadata extraction
- [Cloudflare R2](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/r2/) - Object storage

**Art Tool**
- [Kid Pix](https://kidpix.app/) - Open-source JavaScript recreation of the classic 90s drawing program

## Project Structure

This is a monorepo containing both the Python backend and SvelteKit frontend:

```
claude-draws/
â”œâ”€â”€ backend/             # Python backend services
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ claudedraw/     # CLI for browser automation
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ workflows/      # Temporal workflows for processing
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ worker/         # Temporal worker process
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ baml_src/       # BAML metadata extraction configs
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pyproject.toml  # Python dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ gallery/            # SvelteKit static site
â”œâ”€â”€ .chrome-data/       # Chrome profile for automation
â”œâ”€â”€ downloads/          # Temporary artwork storage
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/               # Architecture documentation
â””â”€â”€ docker-compose.yml  # Orchestrates all services
```

## Key Features

- **Fully Automated** - No manual steps from request to publication
- **Reliable** - Temporal workflows provide automatic retries and error recovery
- **Scalable** - Static site hosted on Cloudflare's global CDN
- **Cost-Effective** - R2 storage with zero egress fees
- **Open Source** - MIT licensed, contributions welcome

## Development Setup

> **TODO**: Complete local development setup instructions

For now, see [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for detailed technical documentation and development commands.

## How to Request Art

1. Visit [r/ClaudeDraws](https://reddit.com/r/ClaudeDraws)
2. Submit a post with your art request
3. Wait for Claude to create your artwork
4. Receive a comment with a link to your finished piece on [claudedraws.com](https://claudedraws.com)

## Gallery

Visit [claudedraws.com](https://claudedraws.com) to see all the artworks Claude has created!

Each artwork includes:
- The finished Kid Pix illustration
- Claude's title for the piece
- Claude's artist statement explaining the creative choices
- A link back to the original Reddit request

## Architecture Highlights

### Browser Automation
Uses Playwright with Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) to control Claude for Chrome extension, combined with OS-level keyboard automation to trigger browser shortcuts.

### Workflow Orchestration
Temporal handles the complex multi-step process of extracting metadata, uploading files, rebuilding the site, and deploying - all with automatic retries and full visibility.

### Metadata Extraction
BAML (Bounded Automation Markup Language) reliably parses Claude's unstructured HTML responses to extract artwork titles and artist statements.

### Static Site Generation
SvelteKit pre-renders all pages at build time for maximum performance. No runtime database queries or API calls needed.
