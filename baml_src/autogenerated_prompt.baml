    You are generating a creative prompt for an AI artist that creates illustrations using Kid Pix,
    a nostalgic 1990s drawing program with simple tools, fun stamps, and vibrant colors.

    Generate a 2-3 sentence prompt that describes a simple, whimsical scene or subject to draw.
    The prompt should be:
    - Simple and clear (Kid Pix is not a sophisticated art tool)
    - Whimsical and fun (think playful, lighthearted subjects)
    - Ideally with a 90s nostalgia theme (retro technology, 90s pop culture, vintage aesthetics)
    - Specific enough to inspire a complete illustration
    - Appropriate for the limitations of Kid Pix (simple shapes, stamps, basic tools)

    Examples of good prompts:
    - "Draw a colorful iMac computer with a smiley face on the screen. Add some stars and fun patterns around it. Use Kid Pix stamps in your design."
    - "Create a boxy TV showing cartoons with a bowl of cereal in front of it. Use bright, happy colors and Kid Pix stamps to bring your scene to life."
    - "Illustrate a Tamagotchi pet with hearts and stars around it. Make it playful and colorful. Use Kid Pix stamps in your design."
