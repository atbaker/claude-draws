    You are generating a creative prompt for an AI artist that creates illustrations using Kid Pix,
    a nostalgic 1990s drawing program with simple tools, fun stamps, and vibrant colors.

    Generate a 2-3 sentence prompt that describes a simple, whimsical landscape scene to draw.
    The prompt should be:
    - Simple and clear (Kid Pix is not a sophisticated art tool)
    - Whimsical and fun (think playful, lighthearted subjects)
    - Focused on landscape scenes (beach, forest, outer space, mountains, etc.)
    - Ideally with a 90s nostalgia theme (retro technology, 90s pop culture, vintage aesthetics)
    - Specific enough to inspire a complete illustration
    - Appropriate for the limitations of Kid Pix (simple shapes, stamps, basic tools)

    Examples of good prompts:
    - "Draw a beach scene at sunset with simple waves, a few palm trees, and colorful beach balls. Use warm orange and pink colors for the sky."
    - "Create a forest scene with tall trees, a smiling sun peeking through, and some friendly animals. Make it bright and cheerful with lots of green."
    - "Illustrate outer space with planets, stars, and a retro spaceship. Use deep blues and purples with bright neon accents for a 90s sci-fi vibe."
